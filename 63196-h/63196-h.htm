<h2 class="nobreak" id="MABEL_RAYS_LESSON">MABEL RAY’S LESSON.</h2>

<p class="center">BY ROSE SEELYE-MILLER.</p>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap.jpg" width="100" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Times had been hard,
harder than common this
past year, and it seemed to
Mabel Ray as though there
was little bright to look forward
to, and less to encourage
her in trying to do
right, trying to be the Christian
she wanted to be some
years ago. She had married
Harry Ray three years
previous; he was a thriving
young merchant, but the past year it had seemed
to the young wife as if he had grown taciturn
and almost fretful if she wanted money for any
little thing which she deemed necessary. Only
this morning he had refused her money for the
fur cape that she really needed so much, especially
if they were going to her folks for New
Year’s day. She had always had what she
wanted when at home, and if Harry begrudged
her the necessities of life, why, she almost believed
she had better go back to that home, for
she was an only daughter and was idolized by
her parents. She sat and thought, and thought,
of her wrongs until the tears came, and then,
after having a good cry, she went into the conservatory
and began picking flowers for the
church decoration in which site was to take
part. There was to be a concert and recitations
and such entertainments, and the funds were to
go to help the needy ones in the parish. For
there were many who needed, many men were
out of work, and their families were destitute
indeed. Mabel was always ready for work of
this kind, it relieved the tedium of the days
when Harry was at the store, and then, be it
known to you, although Mabel would have
blushed had she realized it herself, she liked the
notices in the city personals about the charming
and philanthropic Mrs. Ray who took such a
prominent part in every good work.</p>

<p>Her time was her own; there were no little
ones for her to care for; her household was managed
by a competent housekeeper who looked
well to the domestic arrangements; so, altogether,
Mrs. Ray rather needed something to give her
an idea of usefulness. She was selfish, I am
sorry to say, but when you think that she was an
only child, reared in luxury, with everything she
desired procured for her, it is no wonder that
she learned to think that what she wanted was
the first thing to be considered.</p>

<p>Harry Ray really loved his wife, but he was
bearing a heavy burden of financial care, and
then, besides, he did not possess the means that
Mabel’s father had. He would do anything,
sacrifice anything for her, but she seemed thoughtless
about his sacrifices, and did not realize that
perhaps she too had a duty to perform.</p>

<p>She came home from decorating the church
that afternoon in better spirits, but was almost
vexed when Harry assured her it would be impossible
for him to attend the Charity function
with her that evening. “Wrap yourself up well,
Mabel,” Harry said thoughtfully, “and let the
coachman await you.” He looked almost wistfully
at her bright young beauty and longed for
a word of sympathy and help from her, but none
came. He looked worn and worried, and a
thoughtful wife would have noticed this long
before, but Mabel had not been taught to notice
others in that way.</p>

<p>So Harry went to his work in his office, and
Mabel, dressed richly, went to the Charity function,
where she expected to sing. The evening
passed pleasantly to Mabel, for she loved a brilliant
scene and the compliments she always
received.</p>

<p>The next day she was one of a committee to
dispense the various gifts among the poor. She
rose early for her, and with several others she
visited such haunts of misery as she had never
dreamed of. Poverty had always been a rather
pleasant thing in her mind where people were
always holding some sort of meetings to relieve
it, and where kind hearted women were taking
chicken broth or cups of jelly to others who lay
in bed; she never really thought that perhaps it
would be pleasanter to make one’s own chicken
broth or furnish one’s own jelly, or that perhaps
the one who lay in bed might do something besides
just simply lie there; she did not realize
the tragedy of many of those lives where poverty
binds and sickness holds with chains invincible
beyond all human aiding.</p>

<p>There was more wretchedness depicted in the
squalid homes she visited than she had ever
dreamed of, there was not only poverty but there
was dirt, and there was suffering, and she began
to wonder if there were not other things needed
by the poor besides chicken broth and jelly; she
thought soap would not be misplaced, and that
clothes would find lodgement, she was sure
flowers would be welcomed by some, and she
went home with her heart really aroused from
its selfish stupor. Harry did not come home to
tea, and it was so late before he did come that
being very wearied she retired, and soon fell
asleep. But here, even, she was not free, she
seemed to be in the midst of a white-robed
throng who went about ministering to the needs
of others, and when she spoke to them they only
said “Even Christ pleased not Himself,” and
winged their way on their errands of mercy, and
then she seemed transported to the sunny fields
where flowers bloomed and birds sang their
sweetest carols; there were certain ones gathering
the flowers and when she spoke to them they
said “Even Christ pleased not Himself.”</p>

<p>And then she was transported to the city and
into the haunts of misery and she saw a wan-faced
woman going into a poor hovel with a
blossom in her hand that she had picked from
where it had fallen from some fair lady’s bouquet.
She placed it carefully in a pitcher with
a broken spout and turned the fairest side of the
flower toward a sick one lying upon a pallet of
straw, and when she looked a halo seemed to
surround the flower and a voice said “Even
Christ pleased not Himself.” And suddenly
she seemed to be in her husband’s office, and
there sat Harry, his face was haggard, and there
were tense lines about his mouth, and he seemed
trying in vain to make the accounts tally in the
ledger before him, and ruin and disaster embodied
seemed looking in upon him as he
worked, and finally he laid down his pen, saying
“I can do no more—if it were not for
Mabel.”</p>

<p>Then she was in her own beautiful home and
everything seemed going on strangely; the flowers
in the conservatory had withered and died
because they lived to please themselves, and so
it seemed with everything in the house; the
housekeeper was keeping house to please herself,
the cook was not going to serve the dinner

<div class="page">

<p class="noindent"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
went, and she reached her room and there she
found herself in ease and luxury, taking no thought
for others, and seeking only how she might
please herself; and then there seemed to be the
roaring of a fire and she saw the house and all
therein consumed, but she saw the woman who
had carried the broken flower to the sick child
coming to help her, and then Harry took her in
his arms, and she knew that these were safe because
they had not lived to please themselves.</p>

<p>After awhile she woke and hearing a step
upon the stairs she slipped on a warm dressing
gown and went out softly to meet Harry. He
was surprised and there was that anxious look
upon his face that she had seen in her dream.
She drew him into the parlor and seated him in
an easy chair, and then smoothed the wrinkles
from his brow and begged him to tell her of his
troubles. So the husband and wife conferred
together, and both bearing the burden it grew
lighter, and after a time it passed away. Mabel
seemed different thereafter, her dream was so
realistic that her very heart seemed changed, and
upon its tablets were written in indelible letters,
“Even Christ pleased not Himself.” She did
not care to figure in charity functions where she
would be praised of men, but she sought out the
needy and tried faithfully to aid them. Her aid
was given so unostentatiously, and with such humility
and earnest sympathy, that the poor soon
learned to love her, and her flowers bloomed not
in vain, for they bloomed for the sick and sinning,
for the poor and needy, and I trow that in
sowing good seeds upon earth she will reap a
heavenly harvest that will surprise her. For
she has learned the sweetness of the words
“Even Christ pleased not Himself.”</p>

</div>

<p>There is no topic in natural history so interesting
as the architecture of birds; in
the building of their nests they are exceedingly
ingenious. We may well learn a lesson from
the patience, diligence and perseverance which
they display. Just as men are skilled in different
mechanical employments, so we find in the
bird tribe miners, masons, carpenters, weavers,
basket-makers and tailors.</p>

<p class="caption">HUMMING BIRD’S NEST.</p>
</div>

<p>The humming bird constructs its nest of the
finest silky down, and of cotton, or if these are
not available, some other similar material. The
inside is lined in the most delicate manner with
soft substances; the outside is covered
with moss, usually the color of the bough
or twig to which the nest is attached,
thus giving it the appearance of an excrescence.
The delicacy and ingenuity
of workmanship and skill could hardly
be excelled by human art.</p>

<p>The humming bird is the
“fairy of the feathered race”—the
smallest and most beautiful—and
they are found almost all
over this continent. Most of
them, however, dwell in the far
South, where flowers are ever in
bloom, and summer reigns all
the year round. One species
alone visits our chill Northern States—the
humming bird with the ruby throat.
It comes to us in July and is very shy;
its stay is very short, for toward the first of
September it departs to a warmer climate.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WOODPECKER DRILLING A HOLE FOR A NEST.</p>
</div>

<p>It is only in tropical countries that the several
species of humming bird are seen in their abundance
and variety. The islands between Florida
and the main land of South America literally
swarm with them. In the wild and uncultivated
parts they inhabit the magnificent forests overhung
with rare plants, whose blossoms vie in
beauty with the jewel-like brilliancy of these
animate gems of the air. In the cultivated portions
of the country they abound in the gardens
and seem to delight in society.</p>

<p>Lovely and full of nervous energy, these
winged gems are constantly in the air, darting
from one object to another, and displaying their
gorgeous colors in the sunlight.
When on a long journey, as
during migration, they pass
through the air in long undulations,
raising themselves to a
considerable height and then
falling so as to form a curve.
When feeding on a flower they
keep themselves poised in one
position as steadily as if suspended
on a bough—making a
humming sound with the rapid motion
of their wings.</p>

<p>In disposition these little creatures
are bold and pugnacious. In defending
their nests they will attack
birds five times their size and drive
them off. When angry, their motions are very
violent and their flight as swift as an arrow.
Often the eye is incapable of following them,
and their shrill, piercing note alone announces
their presence.</p>

<p>Among the most dazzling of this brilliant tribe
is the bar-tailed humming bird of Brazil. The
tail is forked at the base, and consists of five
feathers, graduated one above another, at almost
equal distances. Their color is of the richest
flame; the upper part of the body is golden
green, and the under part emerald.</p>

<p>There are more than a hundred kinds of these
birds, and all are noted for their surpassing beauty.
What a beautiful conception in the author
of nature were these exquisite little creatures!
It is as if the flowers had taken wings, and life,
and intelligence, to share in the sports of animal
life.</p>

<p class="caption">NESTS OF THE BOTTLE BIRD.</p>
</div>

<p>The nest of the golden-crested wren, a most
beautiful bird found in England and other parts
of Europe, is a fine example of weaving. It is
made of moss and lichen, and lined with feathers;
it has a very small entrance at the top and
the interior of the nest is also small, bearing no
proportion to the size of the structure. The
weaving of this nest is a work of great labor and
assiduity, and compared with the bulk of the
bird, it is of large dimensions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NESTS OF SOCIAL WEAVERS.</p>
</div>

<p>The nest is suspended from the under surface
of a fir branch, thickly clothed with foliage, by
which it is almost entirely concealed and partly
protected from the rain. Thus, beneath a natural
canopy, this little bird rears her brood,
whose cradle swings to and fro with every
breeze. The eggs are from seven to ten in
number, and of a pale brown color.</p>

<p>A naturalist who watched a nest containing
eight small birds with a powerful opera glass,
observed that the parent birds came to the nest
with food every two minutes, or upon an average
thirty-six times in an hour; and this continued
full sixteen hours a day, which, if equally</p>

</div>

<div class="page">

<p class="noindent"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
divided between the brood, each would receive
seventy-two feeds, the whole amounting to five
hundred and seventy-six!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NESTS OF THE SAND MARTIN.</p>
</div>

<p>The woodpeckers are carpenters; they not
only bore holes in trees in search of food, but
they also chisel out deep holes in which to deposit
their eggs and rear their young. They
generally build their nest in May, selecting an
old apple tree in the orchard; the boring is first
done by the male, who pecks out a circular hole;
as the work progresses, he is occasionally relieved
by the female. They both work with
great diligence, and as the hole deepens they
carry out the chips, sometimes taking them some
distance to prevent discovery or suspicion. The
nest usually requires a week to build, and when
the female is quite satisfied she deposits her eggs,
generally six in number and of a pure white
color.</p>

<p>A bird called the grosbeak builds a nest
shaped like an inverted bottle with a long neck,
through which it passes up to a snug little chamber
above. The nest is skillfully constructed of
soft vegetable substances, sewed together in a
wonderful manner, and suspended from a twig
of a bush.</p>

<p>The social weaver is found in the
south of Africa. Hundreds of these
birds, in one community, join to form a
structure of interwoven grass containing
various apartments, all covered by a
sloping roof impenetrable to the heaviest
rain, and increased year after year as the
population of the little community may
require.</p>

<p>A traveler, returned from a journey
through South Africa, writes: “A tree
with an enormous nest of these birds was
quite near where our party camped for
the night. I dispatched a few men with
a wagon to bring it to the camp that I might
open the hive and examine the nest in its minutest
parts. When it arrived I cut it to pieces
with a hatchet, and saw that the chief portion
of the structure consisted of grass, without any
mixture, but so compact and firmly woven together
as to be impenetrable to the rain. This
is a canopy under which each bird builds its particular
nest; the canopy projects a little, which
serves to let the water run off when it rains.
The nest contained three hundred and twenty
nests, and it was calculated that the number of
birds would exceed six hundred in this one
nest alone.”</p>

<p>The bottle-nested sparrow is a basket maker;
it is found in India and is a very intelligent bird.
It resembles our native sparrow in some particulars,
but its color is brown and yellow. It associates
in large communities and builds its nests
on palm trees. It is formed in a very ingenious
way, by long grasses woven together into the
shape of a bottle, and it is then suspended at the
extremity of a branch, in order to secure the
eggs and young birds from numerous enemies,
such as serpents, monkeys and other animals
which infest that part of the world.</p>

<p>These nests excel in the neatness and delicacy
of their workmanship. They contain several
apartments intended for different purposes;
in one the female deposits her eggs; in another
is stored the food which the male gathers
for his mate during her maternal duties, and a
third is the sleeping apartment for the male
bird.</p>

<p>The sand martin is a most curious member
of the swallow tribe. It appears in the spring
a week or two before the common swallow,
and it is fond of skimming swiftly over the surface
of the water. This bird makes a hole in
a sand bank, sometimes two feet deep, at the
extremity of which it constructs a loose nest of
fine grass and feathers, in which it rears its
young brood. The beak of the sand martin is
like a sharp little awl, very hard, and tapering,
suddenly to a point.</p>

<p>The tailor bird is not the least interesting of
the bird family; it has a curious bill which it
uses like a needle, and it forms its nest by sewing
the materials together instead of weaving.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus7.jpg" width="300" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NEST OF TAILOR BIRD.</p>
</div>

<p>“The tailor bird,” says Darwin, “will not
build its nest to the extremity of a tender twig,
but makes one more advance to safety by fixing
it to the leaf itself. It picks up a dead leaf and
sews it to the side of a living one, its slender
bill serving as a needle, and its thread some fine
fibers; the lining consists of feathers, gossamer
and down; its eggs are white; the color of the
bird light yellow; its length three inches; its
weight three-sixteenths of an ounce; so that the
materials of the nest and the weight of the bird
are not likely to draw down a habitation so
slightly suspended.”</p>

<p>The different methods of nest building evidently
result from the peculiarities of the birds
themselves combined with their surroundings.
Will these styles of architecture be changed or
further developed?</p>

<p>These lines were suggested by a spathe of the

of Wakefield, Mass., who mentioned in his letter to me
when the specimen was sent that he stopped “to
watch the bees go in at the aperture on one side of
the spathe, and listened to their loud humming inside,
as they laid on their load of pollen.” In Thoreau’s
“Early Spring in Massachusetts,” page 172, in writing
of this plant he says: “All along under that bank
I heard the hum of honey bees in the air, attracted by
this flower. Especially the hum of one within a spathe
sounds deep and loud.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_NEW_FRENCH_CANNAS">THE NEW FRENCH CANNAS.</h2>

</div>

<p>I do not know of any class of plants that have
attracted so much attention or have been so
much admired during the past season as the new
large flowering French cannas. And for effectiveness
on lawns in large beds or masses, or as
single specimens in the mixed border, nothing
can be more tropical and impressive. They are
really plants for everybody as they are entirely
free from insect pests, and require but little care
and attention to grow them to perfection. They
succeed well in all kinds of weather, wet or dry,
and are not injured in the least by the severe
storms of wind and rain that we so often experience
during the summer season.</p>

<p>They bloom without intermission from June
until they are destroyed by frost; the spikes of
large flowers somewhat resemble gladiolus but
are really more effective and showy as their
brilliant colors show so grandly against their
tropical foliage. Most, if not all, of the varieties
grow on an average about three feet in
height, and the flowers range in color from deep
crimson to pure yellow, including all the intermediate
shades, many being so beautifully
marked that they are frequently compared to
orchid flowers.</p>

<p>To grow these cannas to perfection as well as
to enable them to properly develop themselves,
they should be given a very deep heavily enriched
soil, and as soon as hot, dry weather sets
in mulched to the depth of at least two inches
with good stable manure, and if the opportunity
offers, water copiously during seasons of drought.
With this treatment a single tuber will make a
clump three or four feet in diameter in a single
season; this will give one some idea of the immense
amount of foliage and flowers a single
specimen will produce.</p>

<p>The plants should not be planted outside until
the weather becomes warm and settled, which
in this vicinity is about the tenth of May, and as
soon as the foliage has been destroyed by the
frost it should be cut off, and the tubers dug and
stored underneath the greenhouse stage, or in
some other situation, where a temperature of 55°
is maintained, until the time arrives for planting
them outside again.</p>

<p>Or the plants can be lifted on the approach of
cold weather, divided, potted up, and grown on
for decorative purposes in either the greenhouse
or window garden. This is a very safe way to
winter over the large flowering cannas or any
other variety of which one’s stock is limited.</p>

<p>When grown as pot plants for winter decoration
the cannas should be given a compost consisting
of two-thirds turfy loam, one-third well
decayed manure and a good sprinkling of bone
dust, mix well and use the compost rough. The
plants should be given as light and sunny a situation
as possible and a temperature of 55° to 60°.
They should also be freely watered both overhead
and at the roots, and as soon as the pots
become well filled with roots a little liquid ammonia
can be given occasionally or else they
must be shifted into larger pots.</p>

<p>Propagation is effected by a careful division
of the clumps, and where the plants are to be
kept in a state of rest the operation should be
performed when they are being planted out in
May. In dividing leave two or three eyes or
shoots to each plant.</p>

<p>Of the many varieties now listed in catalogues
the following are the most desirable and distinct:</p>

<p>Alphonse Bouvier is the grandest deep red
variety known, both truss and flowers being very
large, and the plant makes a most luxuriant
growth of deep red foliage. In color the flowers
are of a rich velvety red.</p>

<p>Capt. P. de Suzzini has handsome light green
foliage and is the most beautiful of all the spotted
varieties. Its flowers are of a rich shade of canary
yellow beautifully spotted and dashed with red.</p>

<p>Francois Crozy has bright green foliage and
very large flowers which are of a bright orange
bordered with a narrow edge of gold—a very
rare and desirable color in cannas.</p>

<p>Madame Crozy grows about three and a
half feet in height and has broad bright green
foliage. The flowers, which are produced in
massive spikes, are of a bright crimson scarlet
beautifully bordered with gold. The plant commences
to bloom when about one foot in height.</p>

<p>Nellie Bowden, in all respects this is identical
with Madame Crozy except in the color of
its flowers which are of a rich golden yellow.
One of the most distinct and beautiful of cannas.</p>

<p>Paul Marquant has dark green foliage and
very large handsome flowers of a bright salmon
scarlet. A very showy variety.</p>

<p>Star of 1891 is so well and favorably known
as to require no description. It is the best of
all for pot culture, as it is of dwarf growth and
very free-flowering. The flowers are of a bright
orange scarlet occasionally edged with yellow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DIFFERENCE">THE DIFFERENCE.</h2>

</div>

<p>It makes all the difference between nice thrifty
plants or scraggly looking ones whether we
read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest a floral
magazine. In walking on the street, the appearance
of the windows or front yards tells you
whether the postman leaves a floral weekly or
monthly. Six weeks ago I saw a row of empty
pots right in the sun, and often an old man was
poking up the soil with his penknife to see if his
bulbs had started. You see he didn’t read up
about hyacinths, but potted them and put them
right in the sun. I can imagine his saying to
his wife, “It’s money thrown away to buy
bulbs; they probably are too old to grow and
I’ve been cheated.” So the poor seedsman gets
the blame, and not his own ignorance. Here is
a window with leggy looking geraniums in it,
just a few leaves on top of the long stems. Now
a little reading in a floral magazine would have
shown her, after blooming all summer, the place
for them is the cellar. Ah! here is a window
that shows intelligence. The hyacinths and
jonquils are showing their buds, moved to the
window from the dark corners where they have
been for weeks forming vigorous roots. Here
are primroses in bloom, and oxalis, and a scarlet
nasturtium makes the room bright on a cloudy
day, and in a corner I can see the Palm Latania.
She takes the magazines and knows what are
good winter plants for amateurs.</p>

<p>In summer one can pick out the magazine
lawns and gardens. Here is one where the man
has two shapely maple trees in front, and has
pruned his “Jac” rose so that it is loaded with
blossoms, and in a circular bed he has put a caladium
in the center, and this shows off the
gladiolus in every shade around it. But the
next front yard is enough to set one’s teeth on
edge. Actually, here is a large square bed with
a tall candidum lily in each corner and, inside,
petunias, zinnias, asters and marigolds in one
blaze of color. The whole effect is like a crazy
quilt thrown over an old fashioned four-posted
bedstead. One sees the roses eaten of worms
and bugs, or planted by the sunflowers and looking
ashamed at their surroundings; whereas the
magazines tell us again and again that roses
need to be watched continually and sprayed to
keep off the insects, and to plant by themselves.
Now for the moral. Let us all show, and lend
our florals, and urge the people to subscribe.</p>

<p>When a tradesman can indulge in a suburban
home or a summer cottage it will
often happen that he will desire to keep a family
horse. If he doesn’t want a horse he will often
want a cow or chickens. In the accompanying
sketch A is a site provided for one or other of
these animals, and it is designedly given a prominent
position that its architecture may receive
treatment in consonance with that of the residence,
that it may be in unison with the surroundings,
and that it may supplant the useless
and ugly pavilions frequently seen.</p>

<p>The approach to the house is direct and convenient
for all points, unless the architect is perverse
enough to put the coal cellar on the opposite
side.</p>

<p>The boundary hedge is of Norway spruce with
room enough to grow and room enough to get
between it and the fence to clip it. I saw a
hedge on paper recently—between two groups
of shrubbery—which was not allowed room to
stand on end.</p>

<p>There is a small vegetable garden, 13, with a
border around it for blackberries, currants, raspberries,
strawberries and such like, and at the
end, 14, either a few fruit trees or flowering
shrubs. The porches, both back and front, are
but a single step above the roadway. The
rooms may or may not be another step above
them, depending somewhat upon the character
of the subsoil, etc. I have not arranged any
special drying ground, for cedar poles may be
set up in the center of any of the round beds, 1
to 8, and clothed with Japanese ivy, Euonymus
radicans, climbing hydrangeas and so on, and
have wires between them.</p>

<p>Now these beds may be further filled with
either bedding plants or select herbaceous plants.
I will assume that it is a summer cottage, and I
would then plant the ground as follows, which
would result in a very different how d’ye do
from that usually seen in such places: 1, Begonia
Evansiana; 2, Funkia grandiflora; 3,
Echinacea purpurea; 4, Aconitum Napellus variegata;
5, Lobelia cardinalis; 6, Sedum Sieboldii;
7, Veronica longifolia subsessilis; 8, six
distinct varieties of Phlox paniculata. These
beds may be varied greatly, but nothing of unreliable
character should ever be planted in
them. Number 1, for instance, might have a
tub of nelumbium in place of the begonia, not
that it is greatly better, but for variety and fancy.</p>

<p>Numbers 9, 9, 9, are shrubbery groups composed
of the following summer-flowering material,
disposed in such manner that all sides
may be seen, and mowed around, and giving
the longest possible margins for the space occupied.
There are but few trees to bloom after
July, they are chiefly Rhus semialata Osbeckii
and R. glabra; Dimorphanthus Mandschuricus;
Koelreuteria paniculata and Clerodendron trichotomum.
None of them are large. Of shrubs
there are a number, and it is strange that they
are so seldom used effectively. Garden shrubbery
looks more devoid of color in August here
than English shrubbery in midwinter. This
should not be with a list such as the following
to draw from and utilize. Just fancy what we
have—and the great artists we have—and tell
me if it should be.</p>

<p>There are the altheas, lots of them; Buddleia
Lindleyana; Calluna vulgaris; Clethras in variety;
Callicarpa purpurea; <i>x</i> Clematis in variety;
Clerodendron viscosum; Desmodiums; Dabœcia
polifolia; Daphne cneorum; Erica vagans;
Euonymus Sieboldianus; Hydrangea Hortensia
varieties; Hydrangea paniculata grandiflora;
Hypericum in varieties; Hibiscus roseus, etc.;
Indigofera Dosua; Kerria Japonica; Lespedeza
bicolor; Leycesteria formosa; Lagerstrœmia
Indica; <i>x</i> Lonicera Halleana; <i>x</i> Periploca
græca; Polygonum cuspidatum; Potentilla fruticosa;
Rubus odoratus; Rhodotypus Kerrioides;
Rhus copallina; Rosa rugosa; R. Wichuriana,
and several hybrids; Spiræa salicifolia, S. tomentosa,
S. Douglassii, and S. Bumalda if it is pruned
after flowering in spring; Tamarix Chinensis;
<i>x</i> Tecoma radicans; <i>x</i> Tecoma grandiflora; Vitex
agnus-castus; Vitex Negundo incisa, and a
large number of sub-frutescent plants of large
size, which may be substituted for such of the
shrubs as are tender north of Philadelphia.
Numbers 10 and 11 are prepared borders
which may well be planted with Hydrangeas
Hortensia, Thomas Hogg, etc., and interspersed
with the pink and white varieties of Lilium
speciosum. Numbers 12, 12 are plants of Sciadopitys
verticillata.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ROSE_LEAVES">ROSE LEAVES.</h2>

</div>

<p>My rose bushes are almost as much admired
for their beautiful foliage as for
their lovely roses. “I never saw such handsome
leaves, why they look exactly like wax.”
This is an exclamation I am growing quite accustomed
to hear from friends, and it is really
true; but I think any one who grows roses as
house plants may have just as handsome foliage
if the proper care is taken of the plants. Once
or twice every week (just as is most convenient)
I wash every leaf with clean, weak soapsuds,
under side as well as upper side. With the
small-leaved Polyanthas it is too tiresome to
wash each leaflet individually, but the foliage
can be sprayed well, and then very carefully and
gently a branch of leaves may be wiped at once,
and in this manner one can go over quite a number
of plants in half an hour. The leaves may
be left without wiping, of course, but the foliage
is apt to be marred unless it is done, as the soapsuds
dries on the leaves in white, unsightly spots.
Roses treated in this way will very rarely be
troubled with pests of any kind, and such rich
waxen green foliage as they will possess is more
beautiful than many flowers.</p>

<p>It is something quite remarkable here, where
the thermometer falls to 40° and 50° below zero,
to see roses blooming outside of a conservatory,
But mine have been doing beautifully in the bay
window all winter, and small as the plants are
they have flowered wonderfully well. At night
the plants are moved away from the window
to a place where they are secure from frost
Queen’s Scarlet seems to make a special effort
to surpass itself each time some other rose comes
into bloom, and every rose it produces is, I
think, more beautiful than its predecessor. It is
in every way one of the loveliest of roses, and
although lacking in the rich fragrance of many
others, it yet possesses a delicate sweetness of
its own. The first time that American Beauty
bloomed for me it bore two exquisite roses, and
the little bush was barely eight inches high, one
of the shoots which produced a flower being
only four inches out of the soil, and the rich, exquisite
sweetness of these large, deep pink roses
is surely unsurpassed by any other.</p>

<p>Sometimes when the buds seem very slow
about unfolding I take a cup of lukewarm water
and gently bending each bud give it a few minutes
immersion. This certainly hastens their
development and in no way injures them. If I
could only have one rose Queen’s Scarlet would
be my choice; if I could have others American
Beauty would certainly be the next one.</p>

<h3 id="Letter_Box_1">Lady Washington and Other Plants.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I see by your September Magazine that you want
the experience of anyone that has had good success
with Lady Washington geraniums. I had good success
with mine. I used as a fertilizer ground oil cake
worked into the soil. It was a year-old plant and
had five bunches of bloom with five pansy-like flowers
in each bloom. They only bloom once a year. I
also used the oil cake on an ivy-leaved geranium and
its growth was beyond my expectations, for in a year’s
time it was eighteen feet long. All plants I have used
it on have done exceedingly well.</p>

<h3 id="Letter_Box_2">Roses in Kansas.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I would like to know what manure that the farm
can furnish to use for the bed of Monthly roses, also,
must they be pruned or cut back the first year, and
what treatment must I give them in the winter here
in Kansas? Must I cut off all branches and cover the
roots or wrap the branches?</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span></p>

</div>

<p>Dig into the bed every spring a heavy dressing
of well rotted stable manure. Protect the
plants in winter with a covering of leaves or
branches of evergreens, prune in spring and
when needed at other times, so as to get a good
growth of new wood.</p>

<h3 id="Letter_Box_3">Ixia—Spider Lily.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Will you please tell me through your Magazine
how to pronounce ixias.</p>

<p>Also, how to treat the spider lily.</p>

<p class="right">A. E. M.</p>

<p><i>Casstown, Ohio.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The division of the word as here given, ix-i-a,
sufficiently indicates its pronunciation.</p>

<p>The spider lilies, or Pancratiums, are plants
growing naturally in marshes or low moist
grounds and require plenty of water in their
growing and blooming stage—afterwards give
less water favoring a season of comparative rest,
but do not allow to go wholly dry.</p>

<h3 id="Letter_Box_4">Plants About a Fish Pond.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I have a nice fish pond that till recently has been
outside of my yard, but finding that the cattle would
spoil the banks I am now taking it into my yard enclosure
and wish to make it an ornament, which it
really is. What kinds of plants are suitable to plant
in the water and around it that would make it showy?
I have now the Egyptian lotus growing in it.</p>

<p class="right">W. C. L.</p>

<p><i>Pennsville, Pa.</i></p>

</div>

<p>One great point in making the planting should
be to secure plants which are hardy, and another
to select those appropriate to the situation.
Both of these ends can be secured by using the
water and bog plants which flourish in that locality.
These might be named, but that would
not assist in securing them. The practical way
is to look up a number of ponds and streams and
visit them every month during spring and summer,
and see how many interesting plants may
be found. Mark their positions, and in autumn
visit the places again and remove such as are
wanted and plant them in similar situations
about the pond. Willows of different kinds and
black ash and poplars and alder trees can furnish
shade, and several kinds of shrubs can be
used to ornament the banks.</p>

<h3 id="Letter_Box_5">Osage Orange Hedge.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Please send instructions for raising Osage orange
hedge.</p>

<p class="right">B. B. R.</p>

<p><i>Spangle, Wash.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The Osage orange is a native of Texas, and
consequently needs warm weather to make its
growth. The seed should be planted at the time
of corn planting in northern localities. A month
previous to sowing place the seed in a dish of
water and let it remain covered with water until
ready to sow. If kept in water the length of
time stated it will germinate in ten or fifteen
days after planting. If kept dry and planted in
that condition it will start only after six or eight
weeks, and very unevenly. When planting time
arrives drain off the water and mix the seed with
dry sand and sow it thinly in drills in good soil.
When the plants are up hoe them and keep them
clean or work them with a cultivator, if on a sufficiently
large scale. The first season’s growth
should make them large enough to set in a hedge.
They can remain standing in the seed-bed until
spring and then be lifted early to be planted.
Cut back the tops and the roots so that each
shall be about five inches in length. The ground
where the hedge is to stand should be well prepared
by deep plowing, and dragging fine and
smooth. If plowed up the year before and cultivated
with some cleaning crop such as potatoes
or carrots it will be all the better fitted. Having
stretched a line for the course of the hedge
the plants can be dibbled in along it, at a distance
of six inches apart, or they can be set in
with a spade; another way is to open a trench
about six inches deep along the line and set the
plants in it, one person placing the plants while
another fills in a spadeful of soil against each
one; then the soil is firmed with the foot against
each plant and afterwards the trench filled. The
after culture for the first year is to hoe and keep
the ground clean. The spring of the following
year before growth starts cut the plants down to
within six inches of the old stock. The following
year do the same; an annual rise of six inches
is sufficient. At the second year’s pruning
and afterwards cut the side shoots so that those
at the base shall be longest, giving the hedge a
broad base narrowing to a line at the top.</p>

<h3 id="Letter_Box_6">Vase in Cemetery.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I have a large reservoir vase twenty-five inches in
diameter for the cemetery. Last summer I had it
arranged by one of our home florists and it did not
do nicely at all and was not in the least satisfactory.
Will you please advise me what plants to use in it this
summer? I thought I would put around the edge to
droop, ivy geraniums, double petunias and nasturtiums
and anything else you may suggest. I have a
pink ivy geranium and would like a white one, and
thought I would like the petunias of some different
colors, perhaps one variegated and some other. The
nasturtiums I shall raise from seed, and I suppose I
might use a little sweet alyssum and lobelia. What
would you recommend for the center plants? Of
course I know it is too early to start it yet, but I want
it all settled so that I can get it ready as early as possible.</p>

<p class="right">K. A. R.</p>

<p><i>Waverly, N. Y.</i></p>

</div>

<p>A vase of plants is not adapted to a cemetery
unless there is a gardener in charge of the
grounds and who will give the necessary daily
care. A garden vase of growing plants needs
daily attention in watering and through the hottest
weather should be supplied twice a day. It
is rare that a cemetery has a gardener in attendance.
We, therefore, would discourage the use
of vases in cemeteries for they are anything but
ornamental unless they have constant care. It
is far better to set directly in the ground whatever
flowering or ornamental plants one chooses
to have. There they will thrive with less attention
than elsewhere. Of course if they can have
the needed care the vases can be filled with such
plants as are usually employed for this purpose,
and, no doubt, the vase which our inquirer complains
of was well filled. It was unsatisfactory,
and probably would be so again another season.
The best place for the vase is on the lawn near
the dwelling. But if it is to be used in the cemetery
then we should try to make the best of it,
and select such plants as will do fairly well with
the occasional attendance they will get, together
with the rain which falls upon them from the
clouds.</p>

<p>Such a selection of plants is difficult to make.
For a center plant perhaps a small sized American
aloe would be as appropriate and appear as
well as any that might be tried. Possibly a
small India rubber plant might be another good
one. For filling in the list is a restricted one.
The portulaca would be reliable; the ageratum
and the petunia would do fairly well, and the
Thunbergia and oxalis might be expected to
hold their own. The othonna would no doubt
do well set around the edge. Perhaps the green
and the variegated vinca would suffer meekly, if
it was demanded of them, and try to show how
brave they are. We fear the nasturtium and geraniums
and alyssum and lobelia would scarcely
hold their own. In some seasons which we
have known in this region, when showers have
been frequent all through the summer, a vase of
such plants as are ordinarily used would do well,
but such seasons are rare. Usually the plants
will suffer for lack of water.</p>

<h3 id="Letter_Box_7">Carnations in the House.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Every year I get a number of carnation plants and
I take the best of care of them, as good as I know
how. At first they look well, but in a short time they
begin to turn yellow at the top and the yellow keeps
going down until it gets to the bottom and they are
dead. Other plants do well with me. What is the
trouble?</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. F. P. W.</span></p>

<p><i>Highlandlake, Colo.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Carnations want a cool, moist air, and cannot
adapt themselves to the high temperature and
dry air of living rooms heated by coal in stoves
or furnaces. To raise the plants one should
have a conservatory off the living room, or at
least an inclosed bay window.</p>

<h3 id="Letter_Box_8">Madeira Vine.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Will you kindly inform me through your “Letter
Box” how to treat a Madeira vine so it will produce
blossoms? I have a vine four years old, has never
done very well until this winter, but the foliage is
beautiful and it seems strange that it does not blossom.
I have got it in a tin wash basin hung with
strings in the window, the sun shines on it from early
in the morning until three o’clock in the afternoon.
It is trained out each side of basin with strings and
measures three feet across, and hangs about one foot
from the glass. I have trained it back and forth from
the basin to the curtain and it has locked itself
through the lace of the curtain. I want to know what
I shall do with it in the spring. I shall have to take
down the curtain, and will it injure the vine to cut it?
I have been told that I ought to clip this winter’s
growth in the spring. I should like to know why it
does not blossom. Please let me know and confer a
favor.</p>

<p><i>Baldwinsville, N. Y.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The Madeira vine is so easily raised it is not
necessary to be particularly careful of a plant
which has already fulfilled its mission. The atmospheric
and root conditions under house culture
are not favorable to the blooming of this
plant. If the tubers are placed in a rich, warm
soil early in spring the plant will make a great
growth and bloom in autumn. When the particular
plant in question is to be moved, in the
spring, a portion of its top growth can be cut
away and then the whole plant slipped out of
the pan into the open ground outside.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center bold">How He Got the Best of Hard Times.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jones wanted an Organ and as Mr. Jones
was one of those good husbands he wanted to
please his wife, but in this case with the hard
times staring him in the face he did not see how
he could spare the money. Anyway he thought
he would see what he could do with the dealers
and agents in his neighboring town, but after
looking over their stock he found the cheapest
Organ he could get would cost him $65.00, and
it didn’t amount to much at that.</p>

<p>This was more than Mr. Jones could afford
and he told his wife so. Although a great disappointment
to them both, they decided they
would have to give up the idea.</p>

<p>A few days after this, Mr. Jones in looking
over Vick’s Magazine saw the advertisement of
the “Beethoven Piano and Organ Co.,” of
Washington, N. J., stating that they sold a first-class
Organ for only $27.50, with stool and book.
He sent for their catalogue which they send free
to all who write.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones now has the organ in his parlor,
for which he paid $27.50, and says it is even
better than the agents offered him at $65.00.</p>

<p>He beat the hard times by purchasing direct
from the factory, thus saving the profits of the
dealers and agents.</p>

<p>The Company offers the same good bargains
on Pianos.</p>

<h3 id="Letter_Box_9">Mildew on Cucumber Vines.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Is there anything that will kill mildew on cucumber
vines in a forcing house without injuring the vines?</p>

<p class="right">A. L. B.</p>

</div>

<p>Try sulphide of potash. Dissolve one ounce
in four gallons of water and syringe the affected
plants with it. It will probably destroy the
mildew and not injure the plants.</p>

<h3 id="Letter_Box_10">Moles.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Can you tell me in your “Letter Box” how to get
rid of moles? We are very much annoyed by them
and find a trap perfectly worthless.</p>

<p class="right">M. H. C.</p>

<p><i>Fort Riley, Kans.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The trap is the best known means of destroying
moles, but of course it requires vigilance and
patience and perseverance in its use, without
these the trap is ineffective. Those who have
tried poisoned corn say that it will effectually
rid a place of moles. Soak the kernels in arsenic
water and place them in the runways. Perhaps
some of our readers may have some experience
to state on this subject.</p>

<h3 id="Letter_Box_11">Pine Apple Air Plant.</h3>

<p>Several inquiries have been received about
the treatment of this plant. Those who are
offering it in the trade advise that the roots be
wrapped in moss and that the plant be wired
upon a piece of bark or wood, that it be placed
in the window, and frequently showered or
sprayed. We have had no experience with it.
The plant is a native of a hot and humid climate
and it is somewhat doubtful that it will generally
succeed in window culture. Unless the window
is a bay, and enclosed with glass on the
side of the room which it is off, and, moreover,
well heated, it will probably in most cases prove
a failure. Its family relationship is with the
Spanish gray moss, and the pine apple.</p>

<h3 id="Letter_Box_12">Phyllocactus latifrons.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Your answers to correspondents in the “Letter
Box” are so helpful that I am led to ask for hints as
to the treatment of the night-blooming phyllocactus.
I have one that blossomed three or four times, but
only a single flower at a time. It seems to spend its
strength in sending out long, round stems two or
three feet in length. I cut off one of these a few weeks
ago and it soon started again at the same spot and is
now three feet long. Ought these stems to be cut,
and is there any special treatment which will secure
blossoms? An answer in your interesting Magazine
will much oblige</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mrs. D. F. G.</span></p>

<p><i>Norwich, Conn.</i></p>

</div>

<p>It is not advisable to remove the shoots as
mentioned, a large and well branched plant is
desirable, and in that condition it should be
capable of producing more flowers. Give a rich
soil with a mixture of sand, and water moderately.
Let it have a position where it will have
the sun a portion of the day.</p>

<h3 id="Letter_Box_13">Mammoth Freesias.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In reply to Mrs. J. F. S., in the January Magazine,
concerning mammoth freesias, I will say I have had
them two years. I do not find the bulb any larger
than the ordinary variety but they produce more flowers—I
had from three to five clusters from each bulb;
they bloom about two weeks earlier and the flowers
are a little larger than the others. I like to grow
them with the others to have a succession of bloom.
I have never failed with freesias, and think Mrs. J.
F. S. has made some mistake in their treatment.
Plant an inch deep in a rich soil, place them in the
dark until they have sprouted, then place next the
glass in a south or east window. Keep the pots in
deep saucers and fill the latter with <i>hot</i> water every
morning. One great secret is to keep their feet warm.
Many people do not give them enough water, they
require a great deal. If any remains in the saucer
from the day before throw it out and give fresh. If
water is poured on the soil it should always be warmer
than the air. In this way I have an abundance of
large perfect flowers, the clusters sometimes remaining
perfect for three weeks. As a last word, have
good drainage and give plenty of heat and water. I
think your Magazine is invaluable.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Can you tell us how to prevent having wormy raspberries?
For the last two years ours have been
worthless from being wormy.</p>

<p>I want to have a bed of violets. Must I use roots
or can I get seeds?</p>

<p>How can cauliflower be put away for the winter?
We cut ours from the stump, turned the leaves over
the heads and packed them closely together, but
some of them have spoiled.</p>

<p>We do not know what insect it is whose larva
infests raspberries. If any of our readers can
supply the information we trust they will give it.</p>

<p>Purchase the roots of violets, it is not practicable
to raise them from seeds.</p>

<p>Cauliflower, like the strawberry, is good enough
to be eaten when it is ready. It does not improve
by keeping. The heads may be kept in
a cool cellar for a considerable time if they are
pulled up with some soil adhering to the roots,
and set in rows in the cellar with the roots covered
with soil. Tie the leaves together or
turn them down over the heads.</p>

</div>

<p>A visit a short time since to the famous greenhouses
of our townsman, Wm. S. Kimball, where
orchids mostly abound, favored us with a view
of the rare yellow-flowered calla, Richardia
Elliottii. Although we had carefully read the
description of this plant we found it really more
beautiful than the image we had formed of it.
The plant in appearance is much like that of the
common calla, Richardia Africana, except that
the leaves are spotted all over with white spots.
The flower spathe is of good size and form, and
of a pure canary yellow color. It will prove to
be a grand companion to the common calla and
is destined to be widely cultivated. At present
the plants are very scarce and expensive and it
will be some time before they can be very freely
offered.</p>

are described, thus bringing together nearly
all that have so far been produced or made public.
The work also contains chapters on planting,
pruning, cultivating, training, fertilizers,
diseases and noxious insects and their remedies,
harvesting, storing, marketing and a brief account
of wine making, in fact almost everything

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PLANT_BED">THE PLANT BED.</h2>

</div>

<p>The enterprise in getting out the artistic and
truly beautiful Floral Guide, and sending
it into our homes during the inclement weather
of these winter days, when we have time to sit
by the fireside and study its pages, enables us,
against the time to plant seeds, to know exactly
what we would like to have among vegetables
and flowers. This beautiful compendium of
vegetables and flowers came as a herald of the
new year, and as the new year seems always to
bring the spring season near, so it naturally fills
the mind with the pleasurable anticipations of
the task of seed planting.</p>

<p>The plant beds are little squares made of very
rich soil, black and friable, with sand intermixed,
on the sunny side of the garden palings that
have a solid base board, or a wall or house, to
afford protection. The rich soil makes a good
bottom heat for forcing gentle growth. My old
colored mammy, who always saved the garden
seeds and gave them out as needed and directed
the gardening operations on the plantation, had
the plant beds made on each side of the garden
gate, one set of little beds for early vegetable
plants, the other for flowers. The soil thoroughly
pulverized, and the seeds planted thickly, it
is surprising how they would spring into life,
and the rapidity with which they would grow.
Thick planting of seeds is only to be advised
when they are intended for transplanting. I
have seen the cabbage bed so full of plants that
it seemed as if two plants or more had sprung
from every seed. Early and late cabbage, the
rows labeled, can be planted in the same bed;
lettuce, pepper grass, parsley and radishes in another,
taking care to sow the radish seed thinly
as the plants will not transplant well, and the
radishes must be used for the table taken from
the place where the seeds are sown. Cabbages
grow better when the small plants are transplanted
to the large bed where they are to stand
for their season’s growth.</p>

<p>After these early vegetable plants have been
set out, later on tomato and egg plant seeds can
be sown in the same beds. Nothing is gained
by forcing these latter, for in my experience certain
vegetable and flower seeds do better planted
late, as the heat of summer is needed for their
development.</p>

<p>The plant bed can be made and planted early
in the season. Here in the South many persons
plant in “old Christmas,” the first twelve days
after New Year, but February or March is better,
I believe.</p>

<p>The flowers that do so well in company with
these vegetables are sweet alyssum, nemophila,
mignonette, snapdragon, candytuft, verbena,
sanvitalia and petunias. Japanese pinks and
Marguerite carnations, Phlox Drummondii and
poppies are better planted where they are to
bloom as they do not transplant well. Sweet
alyssum and nemophila begin to bloom when
about an inch high, and can be transplanted at
any stage of growth, even in bloom; they are
sweet little flowers that make lovely borders,
cute little jars, beautiful hanging baskets, and
when planted in the sides of jars that contain
large plants, hang over the sides in masses of
bloom. The speckled pretty little blue nemophila
always makes me think of birds’ nests
full of speckled eggs in the cool green grass.
Sweet alyssum I love too well to write about;
it would sound like exaggeration.</p>

<p>Petunias do well in the early beds, but also
flourish and bloom finely if their planting is deferred
until the torenia, portulaca, cypress, zinnia,
tageta and real midsummer flowers are planted.
None of these last do any better for early planting.
They will not bloom until their season,
summer, no matter how early they are planted.
The beautiful fall bloomer, cosmos, may be
classed with them. Snapdragons, carnations
and verbena do not bloom in early spring from
seed, but require an early start to bloom in summer
as their growth is not rapid. Sanvitalia,
vinca, and a long list of annuals are beautiful
and well worth raising. Annuals are cheap, but
they subserve a purpose and nothing quite takes
their place, and I confess to a liking for flowers
which I have raised from seeds. It is easy to
exaggerate the beauty of anything that stands in
striking contrast to its surroundings, but these
plant beds early in the season, green and growing,
ahead of everything else, are as pretty as a
picture, and the young, crisp, green vegetables
are suggestive and appetizing.</p>

<p>If twenty-five years of putting Mr. Vick’s seeds
in the ground does not entitle me to render a
verdict in their favor as the best to be had, then
experience counts for nothing. A sure return
for every seed put in the ground is the answer
they give to the question “What shall the harvest
be?”</p>

<p>Further north, doubtless, cold frames are better
for early planting of seeds, but in the South the
plants are more healthy and stand transplanting
much better for exposure to the moderate cold
of the early season in their rich, warm little plant
beds.</p>

<p class="center bold">A CINCINNATI MIRACLE.</p>

<p class="center bold">WHY MR. CHARLES B. NOBLE IS
BEING CONGRATULATED.</p>

<p class="center bold smaller">A Remarkable Case of Being Completely Cured
of Paralysis After Nearly Three Years
of Suffering and Eminent Physicians
Had Declared Their
Best Efforts Baffled.</p>

<p>Newspaper men as a rule place little credence
in patent medicine stories and seldom bother to
even read them. This is not to be wondered at
when it is taken into consideration how often
they are called upon by unscrupulous persons to
fabricate and publish stories of remarkable cures
and perhaps print a picture of the mythical man
or woman supposed to have been cured. That
all medicine advertisements are not mere
“fakes,” and that all newspaper men are not
equally prejudiced is proven by a story published
in the <i>Cincinnati Times-Star</i> of a well-known
newspaper man whose life was saved by
reading an advertisement. So remarkable and
interesting is the story that it is here reproduced
as published in the <i>Times-Star</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles B. Noble, the well-known litterateur,
who has been suffering for nearly three
years with paralysis, was upon the street to-day,
cheerful and active and the recipient of congratulations
from his many friends. There is a bond
of unity between all newspaper men, so that Mr.
Noble’s case appeals to every member of the
craft as well as to every one afflicted as he was.
Mr. Noble has spent the last three years in
traveling from city to city seeking skilled physicians,
to whom he has appealed in vain for
relief. Knowing this, a reporter expressed surprise
at the remarkable cure, but Mr. Noble,
after executing a jig to show that he was as
sound as he looked, let the reporter into the
secret of his cure.</p>

<p>“It was a hard time I had of it,” said he,
“but the last medicine we take is always the
one that cures, and I have taken the last. I
was paralyzed on March 9, 1890, while in the
employ of the David Williams Publishing Company
of New York City as their traveling representative
from Cincinnati. I found the traveling
a great help to me, both in a financial and a literary
way, but suddenly stricken down as I was
at Somerset, O., 150 miles from Cincinnati, I
was incapacitated for both writing and money
making. Luckily my literary productions had
been remunerative, and I had a snug bank account
laid up, but these three years have made
a drain on it.</p>

<p>“I sought a score of physicians, going to the
best specialists in Cincinnati, Chattanooga and
Pittsburg. Twelve Cincinnati doctors, pronounced
my case incurable, but I would not
give up, and after seeking in vain for relief in
Pittsburg and Chattanooga, consulted the best
medical talent in Chicago. Up to January 17,
1893, I had spent $2,500 for doctors and medicine
and was about to give up in despair when
I got hold of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People, through reading the advertisements.</p>

<p>“From the first week of using the remedy I
made a steady improvement, and on April 12,
I put up my cane after using it thirty months.
I certainly believe this medicine is all the proprietors
claim for it, and that it will do all they
say it will. I take pleasure in recommending it
to all similarly afflicted. Like many who have
tried medicine in vain I was doubtful of its value
at first, and only used it when I grew desperate.
Now I can not praise it too highly. It has restored
me to health and strength and I feel
grateful accordingly. Dr. Whittaker pronounced
it a hopeless case of locomotor ataxia.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know there are many who will fancy
anything you say about my case is an advertisement,
but if they want any corroboration, let
them address me at the Y. M. C. A. building,
and I will cheerfully answer all inquiries if
stamps are enclosed.”</p>

<p>Pink Pills, while advertised and handled by
the drug trade as a proprietary article, are not
considered a patent medicine in the sense that
name implies. For many years previous to their
general manufacture they were used as a prescription.
At first their great restorative powers
were not fully recognized and they were chiefly
prescribed for impure blood and general weakness.
Their remarkable success in such cases,
and the fact that there was nothing in the formula
that could do any harm, even if they did
not do any good, led to their being tried in cases
where the skill of the physician and the power
of medicine had entirely faded. Their power
of restoration seemed to border on the marvelous.
They proved to be a never-failing specific
for such diseases as locomotor ataxia, partial
paralysis, St. Vitus’ dance, sciatica, neuralgia,
rheumatism, nervous headache, the after effect
of La Grippe, palpitation of the heart, pale and
sallow complexions, and all diseases of the blood
such as scrofula, chronic erysipelas, etc.</p>

<p>They are also a specific for troubles peculiar
to females, such as suppressions, irregularities,
and all forms of weakness. They build up the
blood and restore the glow of health to pale and
sallow cheeks. In case of men they effect a
radical cure in all cases arising from mental
worry, overwork or excesses of whatever
nature.</p>

<p>Pink Pills are sold in boxes (never in loose
form, by the dozen or hundred, and the public
is cautioned against numerous imitations sold in
this shape) at 50 cents a box or six boxes for
$2.50, and may be had of all druggists or direct
by mail from Dr. Williams’ Medicine Company,
Schenectady, N. Y., or Brockville, Ont. The
price at which these Pills are sold makes a course
of treatment inexpensive as compared with other
remedies or medical treatment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GROWING_ONION_SETS">GROWING ONION SETS.</h2>

</div>

<p>While the practice of growing onions directly
from seed is becoming more extended
all over the country, still the time will
never come probably when the old-time practice
of growing the crop from sets will be done away
with, especially in the South. With the constantly
increasing acreage devoted to this splendid
esculent it is quite likely more onion sets
will be raised and planted ten years hence than
there is at this time. Southern truckers and
market gardeners, along with those who only
grow simply for home use, will continue to use
sets for growing the first crop which is used or
marketed in a green or unmatured state. Thousands
of acres are yearly planted in the South,
putting out the sets anywhere from September
to November, both inclusive. Most any “tyro”
in gardening can grow a crop of onions from the
sets where only failure would result if the seeds
were used. There is hardly anything surer than
making “sets” grow, whereas it is not always
sure that one gets onion seeds that are good and
of such a variety as will make a good crop in
our Southern climate. So much by way of
preface.</p>

<p>The Southern gardeners and truckers depend
almost entirely upon the Middle and Northern
States for their onion sets, although it is quite
practicable for them to raise their own sets if
they choose to do it. The Southern trucker it
seems as a rule, however, would prefer to have
others grow his sets for him. This is all very
well when he can buy them at $1.50 to $2.50 a
bushel, but oftentimes he has to pay twice this
sum for his sets, occasionally three times. There
is an advantage in the trucker growing his own
sets. He can grow just the variety that better
suits our climate, sets of which he cannot always
get with any certainty. The several varieties of
Italian or Spanish onions are far preferable for
the South—kinds like the New Queen, Rocca,
Early Nocera and some others, these do much
better than the American varieties.</p>

<p><i>How to raise the Sets.</i>—There are two ways
of growing—broadcast or in drills. The latter
is to be preferred. For the purpose choose medium
land, not very rich in humus or nitrogen,
but as clean land as possible. Sowings can be
made any time from February 15 to April 15.
Plow the soil and harrow it and run a light
roller over it. Lay off shallow drills fifteen to
twenty inches apart. These shallow drills, not
deeper than a quarter of an inch, should be <i>one
and a half or two inches wide</i>. Just prior to
sowing whiten these drills with landplaster.
Using the freshest seed attainable, sow the seeds
carefully along the drills at the rate of twelve to
fifteen to the square inch. Cover lightly with a
rake and then run a garden roller over the drills.
If the seeds are good there will be a pretty show
of onions in the course of ten days. Cultivate
very shallow and just enough to keep down all
weeds. Any weeds coming up in the drills
must be hand-pulled.</p>

<p>When the small onions later on show signs of
maturity go along and pull them and let them
lie until well cured. Then take up and spread
rather thinly in the coolest, dryest place possible.
They can be spread out under any outhouse
if safe from poultry, etc. If put in a loft,
or where there is much light, spread a slight
layer of straw over the sets. Do not wait until
the onions <i>die down</i> before pulling, but pull just
as soon as the tops show a little yellow. As remarked,
these sets will be planted out again in
September and October, and as late as November
15.</p>

<p>This is a brief statement of procedure. The
directions followed, there will be no good reason
for failure <i>if the seeds are good</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>To be sure “Major Zero” is in full command;
the ground is covered with snow,
and the trees like gaunt skeletons stand out in
bold relief against the background of sky. But
wintry as it seems and is out of doors it is none
too early to begin planning for the coming summer
campaign. Catalogues from nurserymen,
florists and seedsmen are pouring in upon us
laden with good things. Some are really beautiful.
I’ve been experimenting a little in window
gardening, but—woe is me; some varieties
have not responded well to my treatment, not
from any fault of the plant I am confident, but
through my ignorance of its needs.</p>

<p>Different plants require different treatment
and temperature, but I find as a rule the majority
treat them all alike and wonder why they do
not have any “luck” with some kinds. For
example, I gave my pet carnations just as much
water, and as often, as my geraniums. They
began to look sick and I lost three before I found
out they did not require much wetting.</p>

<p>I’m thinking seriously of trying the different
varieties of some one plant, begonias, perhaps.
According to catalogue description they are admirably
adapted to house culture. They do not
require much sun and are free from insects.
Most varieties blossom freely, and even if they
did not the foliage is very attractive. Countess
Louise Erdody is a curiosity and has a history.
It was produced from seed planted in the garden
of Count Erdody, a Hungarian, and named in
honor of the Countess. During the summer begonias
may be grown upon the piazza and a
plant stand filled with well rooted specimens
would be a beautiful ornament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Care of Fruit Trees.</span>—Are we guiltless if
we always take from the tree and return to it
little or nothing? Has man nothing to do, that
he may receive and enjoy these luscious and
health-giving fruits? Should he merely set the
roots of a tree into the soil and then leave it to
combat with starvation and neglect, as thousands
of trees throughout New England are left to do?
Ride through the country and notice the many
orchards standing, sod-bound and in wet undrained
soil perhaps, with all that can be grown
from the soil in the way of hay and pasture taken
off and not a pennysworth of fertilizer added
to it for the trees. Not a dead limb cut
out, to say nothing of those chafing or growing
crossways, not an insect destroyed; and the
poor tree, how it is trying to do its best while
the owner, who has neglected every essential
thing on his part for successful results, exclaims,
“It don’t pay to raise fruit.” I knew a farmer
who plowed his field for corn and planted it,
but who never cultivated, plowed or hoed it.
He had no corn. Did he deserve any? He
said it did not pay to raise corn. I know another
farmer who prepared his ground nicely for
corn, planted and cared for it intelligently, and
received upwards of a hundred bushels of shell
corn per acre. He was amply paid for his care
and expense. He said it paid him.—<i>Edward

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MESEMBRYANTHEMUM">MESEMBRYANTHEMUM.</h2>

</div>

<p>The mesembryanthemum, usually called ice-plant,
is one of the most effective border
plants. Nothing can be prettier around a small
bed than a thick edging of these sparkling rich
green plants, and yet I have never seen it used
in this manner except in my own garden. The
plants grow larger, more robust, coarser perhaps,
when used in this way, but they form an
unbroken edge of great richness. Sow the seeds
in the house and transplant when danger of frost
is over; shade for a few days from sun and wind,
and do not let the ground dry out about the roots
until the plants have started into growth again;
after that an occasional watering is all they require.
Treated in this fashion they grow riotously
and yield a wealth of beautiful, cool looking
foliage for bouquets and all kinds of cut
flower work, which has the additional merit of
keeping fresh a long time even under unfavorable
circumstances. One can pick long sprays of
this pretty greenery without it being missed from
the plants in the least. A low glass dish filled
with ice-plant, the sprays drooping over the edges
gracefully, and a few pale pink flowers peeping
out between the leaves, is an exceedingly pretty
center-piece for the dinner table. In putting
out the plants set them about ten inches apart.</p>

<p class="center">Unfermented, CONCENTRATED and Pure</p>

<p class="center"><span class="larger">JUICE</span> OF THE <span class="larger">GRAPE.</span></p>

<p class="center bold">THE PHYSICIAN’S AID.</p>

<p>Our mission is solely to supply Nature’s own pure food. It is the mission
of the physician, who understands his patient’s needs, to supply the medicine.
Our reason for offering this product to the public, to you, is that it is pure. There is need of such an article of grape juice. We have the testimony
of hundreds of letters to prove the assertion. Nearly all the bottled
juice now on the market contains an antiseptic of some description to prevent
fermentation, generally salicylic acid. Why does such juice fail as a
food? Simply because the antiseptic principle that preserves the juice in
the bottle exerts a similar influence in the stomach, and prevents the natural
action that is part of Nature’s plan for assimilating food. Our concentrated
juice of the grape is absolutely free from all antiseptics, and is
Nature’s best food and strength producer for weak and defective digestive
organs.</p>

<p>Invalids will, of course, seek the advice of their physicians as to the
proper time or quantity, but well people may partake freely, and know
that the certainty of gain far overshadows the possibilities of excess.</p>

<p class="center bold">THE CONSUMER’S SUPPORT.</p>

<p>The grape cure has been found in many cases to rapidly reorganize and
reconstruct the blood current, and to surprise the tissues and excite the
nervous system into health. The beverage form of grape juice is an agreeable
and wholesome nutrient in a great variety of sicknesses. Its fruit
acids, its blood salts and its grape sugar make it a valuable medicine. It
affords a nourishing and easily managed food for dyspeptics of many
kinds. We seek to supplant alcoholic and fermented drinks by something
more wholesome, more satisfying and refreshing—something embodying
all the best principles of ripe grapes marred by nothing that would falsely
stimulate or excite, and in the new era that is dawning, the life-giving
principles of the grape, in their purest condition, will enter every home as
a comfort and a blessing, instead of a delusion and a snare.</p>

<p>Its sub-acid taste and easiness of assimilation give it a high value in fevers
of every sort. Its concentration, keeping qualities and palatability
give it certain advantages over the beverage form. It is agreeably administered in aerated water or hot or cold water.</p>

<p>Two varieties of our concentrated juice suitable for redilution with any aerated, carbonated or pure cold water are bottled under our labels—i.e.,
Red, Zinfandel, White, Muscatel.</p>

<p>Sold only in pint bottles, the contents of which are equal to <span class="smcap">one-half gallon of fresh grape juice</span>. <b>Price, 65 cents per bottle.</b> For

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MARGUERITE_CARNATIONS">MARGUERITE CARNATIONS.</h2>

</div>

<p>“My first sowing was early in February, 1892.
The plants came into bloom the middle of June,
and I had more or less flowers from them all
through the following winter and spring. In
1893 I made two sowings, one the beginning of
February, and another the end of March, to secure
plants for winter flowering. About eighty
of these in six-inch pots were plunged out of
doors until the middle of November; then removed
indoors and placed in light airy position.
They have been flowering profusely ever since,
and will continue doing so to the end of May.”
These statements are made by John Milne in
the <i>Journal of Horticulture</i>. Another writer
in the same publication says:</p>

<p>“Those who have not yet grown these carnations
have missed much. I sowed some seeds
at the end of February last year in a mild heat,
and the seedlings were potted when large enough,
the bulk of them eventually finding their way
into pots five and a half inches in diameter.
Some few were grown in pots an inch less, but
I noted those in the larger pots were much better
every way. Small pots do not afford sufficient
scope for the roots, as these are freely
made, and being very fibrous they absorb a quantity
of moisture. A moderately rich compost is
essential, the plants requiring a fair amount of
stimulative food to enable them to continue longer
in flower than they do when in a starved condition.
To test these carnations I planted some
in the kitchen garden, but I found that those in
pots flowered much the best. About ninety per
cent. of these carnations come double from seed,
which is a great gain, as single flowers are really
of little use for decorative purposes. What I
admire about them is the large number of self-colored
flowers that are produced. The bulk of
them are deliciously scented, and all fringed at
the edges of the petals. When the weather permitted
the plants were assigned a position out of
doors where they could obtain all available sunlight,
were given plenty of space, and well supplied
with water at the roots. Directly the pots
in which they were to flower were full of roots,
weak liquid manure was supplied to them freely.
By the early part of July they commenced to
flower, and kept on unceasingly until the early
part of November out of doors. Where buttonhole
bouquets are in demand these Marguerite
carnations afford excellent material for the making
of this favorite adornment, and as the carnation
is a popular flower for the purpose this new
race is doubly valuable.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_PRETTY_FLOWER_STAND">A PRETTY FLOWER STAND.</h2>

</div>

<p>Here is something you can make for yourself
before another summer comes. This
is a flower stand, and the simplest contrivance!
Saw off an old cedar tree about two feet below
the first branch, then saw it off again about two
feet above the first branch. The thicker the
branches on this unsightly stump the better for
your purpose. The branches must next be
chopped off irregularly, leaving some a yard and
some half a yard in length. Bury the lower end
of the stump about one foot in the ground, and
on the end of each branch nail a piece of board
about ten inches square to serve as a shelf.
These shelves must be firmly nailed so that
boxes or pots can be set upright on them. Now
paint the whole thing green and you have a
pretty flower stand. You will not believe it until
you try it, but it is beautiful. Instead of
bedding out the plants you wish for winter
flowering, try the plan of keeping them on this
stand out of doors during the summer, where
they will get all the benefit of the sun and dew.
On the approach of winter they will only need
to be brought indoors, and will be in a much
better condition for blooming than if they had
been taken up at the risk of breaking half their
roots and potted in a hurry.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HANGING_BASKETS">HANGING BASKETS.</h2>

</div>

<p>Only certain kinds of plants are suitable
for hanging baskets; such as are of low
compact growth, to cover the surface, and such
as are of drooping or trailing habit, to hang over
the sides, are best for the purpose. For the center
use some graceful plant of upright growth.
In setting the plants in hanging baskets a layer
of moss at least one inch in depth should be
spread over the bottom and sides, so that the
water may be held and prevented from washing
through. To have the plants bloom freely they
should be hung where they will be exposed to
the sun at least two hours every day, and in dry
weather they need copious watering. A good
plan is to dip the whole basket in water until it is
thoroughly soaked. It can be allowed to drip
before being again hung up. Watered in this
way the soil retains the moisture much better than
when the water is only poured on the plants.</p>

<p>Panicum variegatum is one of the most valuable
plants I have tried for baskets or vases. It
is a species of grass from New Caledonia, of
very graceful habit of growth, with beautiful variegated
foliage striped, white, carmine and
green. The ivy-leaved geraniums are excellent
climbing or trailing plants adapted to hanging
baskets. They have a fine, thick, glossy foliage,
which of itself would warrant their cultivation,
but they also have the charming attraction
of possessing beautiful flowers as well
as foliage. Any one who once succeeds in getting
a good variety started in a basket will never
allow their window garden to be without a plant
of this kind, as they all bloom with the greatest
freedom. Chas. Turner is my favorite variety
of the ivy-leaved geraniums.</p>

<p>Nasturtiums are lovely in a “rustic” hanging
basket, that is, one made of rough and gnarled
roots and limbs of trees. All the varieties of
oxalis are pretty grown in earthenware baskets,
and wire baskets lined with bright green moss
are especially suitable for the different varieties
of tradescantia, or “wandering jew.” There is
a drooping variety of cactus, Cereus flagelliformis,
admirably suited for hanging baskets. I
have seen this planted in a large ox horn suspended
by chains, and it made a most unique
ornament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Unemployed in England.</span>—The sufferings
of the unemployed in England, if not
greater, are at least more vocal than ever, and
remarkably various are the remedies proposed.
Besides the project already named, Mr. Keir
Hardie suggested to Parliament the establishment
of an eight hours day and the prohibition
of overtime in Government factories, the reclamation
of waste lands and foreshores, the reafforesting
of the country, and the provision of
suitable accommodation for the aged poor. The
<i>Daily Chronicle</i> revives an old scheme for reclaiming
the Wash, and so adding a “new country”
to England. Mr. Chamberlain’s hope is
for extended markets for national trade. A conference
of vestries, presided over by Lord Onslow,
proposed to Mr. Gladstone the formation
of light railways, made and worked as in Ireland,
to carry away the refuse of London. The
gravity of this problem throughout the United
Kingdom can hardly be overestimated, and its
conditions are not so transient as those in the
United States. There is no such “army of unemployed”
in Chicago or New York as in London.—<i>From
the “Progress of the World,” in
the February Review of Reviews.</i></p>

<p class="center">TO CATARRH SUFFERERS</p>

<p>A clergyman, after years of suffering,
from that loathsome disease, Catarrh, and
vainly trying every known remedy, at last
found a medicine which completely cured
and saved him from death. Any sufferer
from this dreadful disease sending his
name and address to Prof. Lawrence, 88
Warren Street, New York, will receive the
means of cure free and postpaid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peach Yellows.</span>—This disease is making
considerable trouble in certain parts of the country.
It attacks trees about the time they are
coming to the age of most prolific bearing to such
an extent that in certain portions of the peach-growing
regions healthy old trees are unknown.
The symptoms of the disease are: Yellowish-green
color of leaves; small leaves tinged with
red; the new shoots small, wiry, and clustered,
especially when growing upon the trunk or larger
branches; fruit ripens prematurely, is highly colored,
and insipid or bitter to the taste. The
sickly yellowish-green foliage may be due to injury
or lack of nourishment, but when coupled
with the other characters given the presence of
the “yellows” can be considered as certain.
The only sure way is to dig out and burn every
tree as soon as it is seen to be affected. This
plan has been followed in Michigan, where, between
1870 and 1880, the disease was very bad.
Now hardly a case of “yellows” can be found
in many of the peach regions. Constant attention
and prompt action have proved successful,
in this case, at least.</p>

<p>Straws show
which way the wind
blows. Watch them—and
be convinced. When you see all sorts
of washing powders patterned
after <i>Pearline</i>; when you see it
imitated in appearance, in name,
in everything except merit; when
you find three persons using <i>Pearline</i>
where two used it a year ago; when you hear it as
a household word with the best housekeepers; when
you find its former enemies now its staunchest friends;—then
you may know the wind is taking you along
toward <i>Pearline</i>.</p>

<p>Why not go with it? You are losing money by
trying to head the other way; money, and labor,
and time and patience.</p>

<p>Go with the rest—use <i>Pearline</i>—and you stop
losing, and begin to gain. Millions realize that there
is everything to gain and nothing to lose—with
<i>Pearline</i>.</p>

<p class="center larger clear">Blowing</p>

<p>Peddlers and some grocers will tell you, “this is as good
as” or “the same as Pearline.” IT’S FALSE—but what a
puff for Pearline.</p>

<p class="center">NEW EVER-BLOOMING<br />
<span class="smaller">DWARF CALLA,</span></p>

<p class="center larger bold">“THE GEM”</p>

<p>This is a novelty of great merit. The only objection to the old
variety is that it sometimes grows tall and scraggly, but the
“<b>Little Gem</b>” is of strong and dwarf habit. The foliage
which is of a lustrous dark green is in great abundance. The
flowers are produced in the greatest profusion, being literally an
ever-bloomer, it will bloom freely all summer in the open
ground, in September it can be lifted and potted and will continue
blooming all winter. The “Little Gem” Calla will continue
to grow and bloom for years without ceasing, and the quantity
of flowers which a large plant will produce is astonishing, the
flowers are snowy white in color, and of good size, it seldom grows
higher than fifteen inches. Price for plants that will bloom this
season, <b>30 cents each</b>. <b>For $1.00 I will mail 5 plants
to one address.</b></p>

<p><b>ONLY $1.00</b> will buy any one of the collections
named below, delivered
safely by mail, postpaid, to any address. The collections are all
fine, strong plants of the best varieties and are marvels of cheapness.
Every plant is plainly labeled, and there are no two varieties
alike in the same collection.</p>

<p><b>FOR $1.00 I will mail FREE 20 Prize-winning Chrysanthemums; 20 fine Single
and Double Flowering Geraniums for $1.00; 20 Choice Ever-Blooming
Carnations for $1.00; 20 Flowering Begonias for $1.00; 20 Assorted Flowering Plants

<p>This new variety of large podded, handsome Table Pea,
introduced by us, jumped at a bound into instantaneous
favor all over the United States.</p>

<p>The plants stand from three and a half feet to four feed
high, and bear large, long pods, mostly in pairs, which are
packed remarkably close with flattened, greenish-white,
wrinkled peas, and these, when cooked, are of the finest
flavor and color. The weight of the Pea compared to the
pod is much greater than usual, producing more shelled peas
than any other variety.</p>

<p>In season it follows Little Gem and comes before Champion
of England. Both for the market and family garden
this Pea will be found of the highest merit.</p>

<p>Everybody is charmed with this variety, and whether for
private use or marketing, a liberal quantity should be planted.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Price, per packet 10 cents; per pint 30 cents; per
quart 50 cents.</b></p>

<p class="center larger bold">Vick’s Pea, King of the Dwarfs.</p>

<p>This new seedling, introduced by us, in season follows closely McLean’s Little
Gem, coming into market in the space intervening between the early and the late
varieties. The vines are sturdy and remarkably vigorous, growing about two inches
taller than the Little Gem, and bearing a profusion of pods and Peas in the
pod, with all of the principal dwarf varieties, including the American Wonder, we
find that the King of the Dwarfs outyields them all by 20 per cent., all planted at the
same time, on the same soil, with equal cultivation.</p>

<p>It is a cross between American Wonder and McLean’s Little Gem, and is the most
promising of forty different seedlings. In flavor it is unsurpassed.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Price, per packet 15 cents; per pint 75 cents; per quart $1.25.</b></p>

</div>

<p>No bicycle ever made at all approaches them in
beauty and style joined to excellence of construction,
none so strongly appeals to the experienced
rider as meeting every requirement of a perfect
mount.</p>

<p>The need of repairs for Columbias will be infrequent
under our new system of inspection, which
now begins with a scientific analysis of the raw
material by a metallurgist, and only ends when
thorough tests have been made of the complete
machine and all its parts.</p>

<p><b>1894 Standard Price, $125.00.</b></p>

<p class="smaller">Seven newly designed wheels are shown
in our 1894 Catalogue which will interest
every cyclist. Our agents furnish it free,
